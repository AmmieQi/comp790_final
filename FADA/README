This FADA folder includes three experiments:

1. FADA_digits:
This file include experiments on MNIST and SVHN.
Both MNIST and SVHN can be the source and the target data.
To run the experiment, make sure to:
    1) Set "M2S" as True for MNIST being the source, SVHN being the target. Change to False otherwise.
    2) Set "batch_size", "num_samples" and batch sizes accordingly

2. FADA_domainnet:
This file include experiments on DomainNet
To run the experiments:
    1) change the source and target file path to the local file path
    2) set "batch_size" and batch sizes accordingly
    3) use "python FADA_domainnet.py --n_classes N", where N is the number of data for the target set. N is default to be 7.

3. FADA_extension:
This is an extension idea on FADA, it's build on digital dataset, but did not reach a good performance.
